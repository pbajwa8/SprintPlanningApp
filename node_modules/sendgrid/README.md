Version 3.X.X brings you full support for all Web API v3 endpoints. We
have the following resources to get you started quickly:

-   [SendGrid
    Documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/index.html)
-   [Usage Docs](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/master/USAGE.md)
-   [Example
    Code](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/tree/master/examples)
- [Migration from v2 to v3](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Send/v3_Mail_Send/how_to_migrate_from_v2_to_v3_mail_send.html)

Thank you for your continued support!

All updates to this library is documented in our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

# Installation

## Setup Environment Variables

First, get your free SendGrid account [here](https://sendgrid.com/free?source=sendgrid-nodejs).

Next, update your environment with your [SENDGRID_API_KEY](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys).

```bash
echo "export SENDGRID_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'" > sendgrid.env
echo "sendgrid.env" >> .gitignore
source ./sendgrid.env
```

## Install Package

The following recommended installation requires [npm](https://npmjs.org/). If you are unfamiliar with npm, see the [npm docs](https://npmjs.org/doc/). Npm comes installed with Node.js since node version 0.8.x therefore you likely already have it.

Add the following to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "sendgrid": "^3.0.7"
  }
}
```

Install sendgrid-nodejs and its dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Alternative Installation

You can also install sendgrid locally with the following command:

```bash
npm install sendgrid
```

## Dependencies

- The SendGrid Service, starting at the [free level](https://sendgrid.com/free?source=sendgrid-nodejs)
- [Nodejs-HTTP-Client](https://github.com/sendgrid/nodejs-http-client)

# Quick Start

## Hello Email

```javascript
  var helper = require('sendgrid').mail
  from_email = new helper.Email("test@example.com")
  to_email = new helper.Email("test@example.com")
  subject = "Hello World from the SendGrid Node.js Library"
  content = new helper.Content("text/plain", "some text here")
  mail = new helper.Mail(from_email, subject, to_email, content)

  var sg = require('sendgrid').SendGrid(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY)
  var requestBody = mail.toJSON()
  var request = sg.emptyRequest()
  request.method = 'POST'
  request.path = '/v3/mail/send'
  request.body = requestBody
  sg.API(request, function (response) {
    console.log(response.statusCode)
    console.log(response.body)
    console.log(response.headers)
  })
```

## General v3 Web API Usage

```javascript
var sg = require('sendgrid').SendGrid(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY)

// GET Collection
var request = sg.emptyRequest()
request.method = 'GET'
request.path = '/v3/api_keys'
sg.API(request, function (response) {
  console.log(response.statusCode)
  console.log(response.body)
  console.log(response.headers)
})
```
